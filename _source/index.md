... and you can hire me as a web technology consultant.

**I like JavaScript, especially Cordova/PhoneGap, node.js and AngularJS** and I am passionate about clean code & documentation, development workflows and developer tools.

I started as a freelance web developer in 1999 and created a lot of PHP/HTML and CSS code.
Since 2006 I focus mainly on [**JavaScript in mobile browsers**][pwstart] and as of late in [**node.js servers**][nodepost].
I have been [speaking][events] and [writing][dotnetarticle] about this and I maintain an open source [node.js boilerplate][node-base].

**My professional aim is to stay on top of recent web technology and educate my clients about it.**

As a web technology consultant **I can help your team**

- select the right technology and tools for your web-related project
- set up their JavaScript development environment and workflow
- understand developer tools and be more productive
- implement JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3 projects

Please write me an email to <rocco@pavingways.com> or tweet something to [@geeroc][twitter].
