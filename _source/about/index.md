My name is Rocco Georgi and this is my portfolio page. It lists a bit of my educational and professional background along with skills and milestones that I find worth mentioning.
There are dedicated pages for some [projects][projects] and [events][events]. You can [hire me as freelancing web technology expert][hireme] (which is part of the reason why this page is always in desperate need of an update).

**I think staying up-to-date with current technology is an essential duty as a software developer and I try to keep up with it.**

To evolve as a software developer and consultant I constantly do reasearch and did [presented at a few conferences][events], mostly about JavaScript on mobile devices. Some of my writing [was published by others][events] and I conducted several workshops for IT departments and individuals.

When Node.js came out in 2009 [**I became interested**][nodepost] and I maintained an open source [node.js boilerplate][node-base] (now outdated) for a while.

Blockchain and DLT technologies have become very interesting to me in 2016 and I am learning as much as I can.

Hybrid Apps, Ionic, Angular, TypeScript, Cordova and fastlane are my main professional topics currently.

I live in Frankfurt, Germany. I know a little German ... he's sitting <a title="(if you get this, I'll buy you a coffee)">over there</a>.

## Background

In 1991 I started programming on a C64.
Five years later I wanted to become an [industrial designer][industialdesign] because I liked the looks of my [Colani][colaniwiki]-designed [486 SX 25 PC-Tower][colanipc] and drawing cars.
Instead I opted for a university degree and studied **Software Engineering and English Linguistics (M.A.)**.

In 1999 I started **freelancing as a web developer** during university and created a lot of MySQL/PHP/HTML/CSS code - the [LAMP stack][lamp] was a long-time friend of mine.

I did a one year internship at Siemens Travel Management in San Jose, USA in 2002/03 helping to build a data warehouse and reports generator.

In 2002 I developed a [web-based real-estate management software][maklerstararch]: that was still used by some companies in 2014.

Freelancing as a **full stack developer** ever since [I built hundreds of websites][grocportfolio], forums, shops and other web-apps, also several mobile apps and even some games.
I have worked on my own, for individuals, startups, and all other sizes of companies on equally small and big projects.

In 2006 I started focusing mainly on [**JavaScript in mobile browsers**][pwstart].
Later I co-founded a business called [PavingWays Ltd.][pw] to bundle research and consulting for clients mainly in the UK.
