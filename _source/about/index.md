## Background

I started programming on a C64 in 1991.
In 1996 I wanted to become an industrial designer in part I liked the looks of my Colani-designed 486-SX-25 PC-Tower and drawing cars.
I prefered to get a university degree and studied Software Engineering and English Linguistics (Masters).

During university I started as a freelance web developer in 1999 and created a lot of PHP/HTML and CSS code.

I did a one year internship at Siemens in the US (San Jose) helping to build a Cognos-based Data Warehouse and I built a report generator in TSQL on a MSSQL Server bringing report generation time down by a few orders of magnitude.

In 2003 I developed a web-based real-estate management software that was still used by some companies in 2014.

Freelancing as a **full stack developer** I built hundreds of websites, many web-apps, a fews mobile apps and even some games over the past years.
I have worked on my own, for individuals, startups, and all other sizes of companies on equally small and big projects.

In 2006 I started focusing mainly [**JavaScript in mobile browsers**][pwstart] with my company [PavingWays Ltd.][pw]

As of late I also [got interested][nodepost] in **node.js**. I also maintain an open source [node.js boilerplate][node-base].

In a long-term consulting gig since 2008 at Deutsche Telekom and some related companies, currently at T-Systems.
