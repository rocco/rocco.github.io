Hi, I am Rocco Georgi. This is my portfolio page listing some of my educational and professional background along with skills and milestones that I find worth mentioning.
There are also dedicated pages for some [projects][projects] and [events][events]. You can [hire me as freelancing web technology expert][hireme] (which is part of the reason why this page is in desperate need of an update).

## Background

In 1991 I started programming on a C64. 
Five years later I wanted to become an [industrial designer][industialdesign] because I liked the looks of my [Colani][colaniwiki]-designed [486 SX 25 PC-Tower][colanipc] and drawing cars.
Instead I opted for a university degree and studied **Software Engineering and English Linguistics (M.A.)**.

In 1999 I started **freelancing as a web developer** during university and created a lot of MySQL/PHP/HTML/CSS code - the [LAMP stack][lamp] was a long-time friend of mine.

I did a one year internship at Siemens Travel Management in San Jose, USA in 2002/03 helping to build a data warehouse and reports generator.

In 2002 I developed a [web-based real-estate management software][maklerstararch]: that was still used by some companies in 2014.

Freelancing as a **full stack developer** ever since [I built hundreds of websites][grocportfolio], forums, shops and other web-apps, also several mobile apps and even some games.
I have worked on my own, for individuals, startups, and all other sizes of companies on equally small and big projects.

In 2006 I started focusing mainly on [**JavaScript in mobile browsers**][pwstart].
Later I co-founded a business called [PavingWays Ltd.][pw] to bundle research and consulting for clients mainly in the UK.

**I think staying up-to-date with current technology developments is an essential duty as a software developer and I try to keep up with it.**

In efforts to evolve from being a software developer I did some reasearch and [presented at several conferences][events], mostly about JavaScript on mobile devices. 
Some of my writing [was published by others][events] and I went on consulting clients and doing workshops for IT departments and individuals.

Since 2009 I am in a consulting/development gig at Deutsche Telekom and some related companies, currently at T-Systems.

As of 2010 [**I am interested in node.js**][nodepost] and I maintain an open source [node.js boilerplate][node-base].

I currently live in Frankfurt, Germany and I used to run the local HTML5/PhoneGap Meetup group. I know a little German. <!-- If you get this joke, get in touch and I'll buy you a coffee. -->
