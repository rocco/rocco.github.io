## Work ahead

Sorry this project description is still in the works.

<!--

Welcome to our Mobile Widget and Application Store Wiki. We try to be a concise source for developers and publishers of mobile widgets providing information on app stores, mobile widgets and standards. This wiki is a collection of our research in this area and you are welcome to contribute if you have any further information or corrections!

Please make sure you follow our Twitter feed to get updates in this wiki directly: @pavingways

We are defining Mobile Widgets as client-side mobile web applications.

Therefore widgets written in languages other than HTML/CSS/JavaScript or using proprietary technologies are not in our scope - same for app stores we are looking at.
