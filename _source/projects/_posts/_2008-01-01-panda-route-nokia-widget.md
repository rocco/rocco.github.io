Our award-winning travel planner was developed as a Web Runtime (WRT) widget during the 24-hour Hackathon at Nokia’s Developer Summit 2009. 

Panda Route is a tool to keep important travel data on your phone while out and about. 
Its home screen widget displays a feed of matching Twitter messages. 
The widget is available for download on the Ovi Store.


Our Panda Route Travel Planner widget has made it to Nokia’s Ovi Store. The basic idea behind the widget is that you have all your important travel data with you while you are on the go. It works pretty easy: before you start your journey, you enter all the details of your upcoming trip that you need to remember (e.g. airline, flight times, hotel address, rental car reservation number etc.). Then the widget shows you the current step of your journey with all the needed information depending on the current time. On your Nokia N97 home screen this information will be shown too. So you have access to this information without interaction with the application and even when not connected to the Internet.

We also integrated a Twitter feed matching the location of your upcoming destination. It is a great source for any kind of information, such as events, news, things to watch out for or people nearby; and you know what is going on there before you arrive.

The widget is free and available for Nokia N97. So, before you start your next trip, try it out and let us know what you think!
