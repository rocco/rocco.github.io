Out of my own needs I developed a node.js boilerplate that I can hopefully use in further projects.
You can use it too as it is open source and on [GitHub][nodebasegh].

## Challenge

The Idea was to have a good starting point for a backend for my web apps. 
So this needs to contain authentication, session handling, storage access and a RESTful API structure for frontends.

Also I like to keep it clean so the project structure is based on community best practices.
To help others use this project - and myself to remember what I did - I extensively inline documented what is going on where.

To get more details, please refer to the [README][nodebaseghreadme] file of [the project on GitHub][nodebasegh].
