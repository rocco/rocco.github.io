title: Realizing that Node.js is important

This is a post about a blog post ...

Why? Because for me it was a big milestone to realize and actually get what Node.js means and that it is an important thing.
Looking at it now (4 years later) it seems I was right.

Back then I felt like I had to urgently blog about it and so I wrote a [post on pavingways.com][pwpost] right away.

The post made it into the Node.js Wikipedia page as a reference - it was there in EN, now at least remains [in the KO and ZH versions][wikipedia].
It was also listed in an article in [Smashing magazine][smashing].


# Summary, Findings and Discoveries

One of the comments below the original post is spot on: 
**"Wow. I feel like tearing down everything I wrote and rewrite it with node.js".**
