Amongst [James Pearce](https://www.facebook.com/jamesgpearce) and [A. Todd Emerson](http://www.linkedin.com/in/toddemerson) I was one of the technical reviewers for Gail Frederick's and Rajesh Lal's Book ["Beginning Smartphone Web Development"](http://www.amazon.com/dp/143022620X/).

## Learnings

The book turned out pretty good.
Technical reviews mean a lot of work if you do it right.
I was even able to point out some minor problems.
Other than that Gail and Rajesh did a great job and the book was a good intro to web development on mobile phones back in the days.
Yay, I'm in a book!
