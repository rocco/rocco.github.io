XTech 2006 was the first conference I attended. I was blown away by most of the talks.
I presented [CarCulatr, a mobile app based on web technology][carculator], during a lightning talks session.

[Jeremy Keith][adactio] talked to me after the sessions and he was kind enough to take me [drinking with some quite famous people][medrinking].

I also met [Brian Suda][briansuda], [Mike Smith][mikesmith] - back then working for Opera - he gave me an "I open the WEB" T-Shirt.
Mike also introduced me to [HÃ¥kon Wium Lie][hakonwiumlie], CTO at Opera.

Meeting all these people was my main take away I guess, along with learning a lot and knowing I could present stuff at conferences.
Amsterdam is great too, but that I knew before.
